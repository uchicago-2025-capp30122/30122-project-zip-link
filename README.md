# Project Repository Template

This template is intentionally mostly empty, to give you experience starting a project from scratch.

A good first command would be to run `uv init` and add some libraries and tools that you are using.

Before the final milestone submission, you will need to replace this file with a README as described here: https://capp30122.netlify.app/coursework/project/#readmemd
